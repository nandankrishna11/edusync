# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for the Classroom + RAG Web App. The system currently has basic authentication but lacks proper role-based permissions and access control mechanisms. This implementation will establish secure, role-specific access to features and data across both backend and frontend components.

## Glossary

- **RBAC_System**: The Role-Based Access Control system that manages user permissions and access rights
- **User_Role**: A classification assigned to users that determines their access level (Student, Professor, Admin)
- **Permission_Set**: A collection of specific actions and resources that a role can access
- **Protected_Route**: Frontend routes that require specific role permissions to access
- **Protected_Endpoint**: Backend API endpoints that validate user roles before processing requests
- **Role_Context**: Frontend context that provides role-based UI rendering and navigation
- **Authentication_Middleware**: Backend middleware that validates JWT tokens and extracts user roles
- **Authorization_Decorator**: Backend decorator that enforces role-based access to endpoints

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to define and manage user roles with specific permissions, so that I can control access to different features based on user responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RBAC_System SHALL support three distinct user roles: Student, Professor, and Admin
2. WHEN a user is created, THE RBAC_System SHALL assign a default role of Student
3. THE RBAC_System SHALL store role information in the user database model
4. THE RBAC_System SHALL provide role validation functions for both backend and frontend
5. THE RBAC_System SHALL allow role updates only by Admin users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to access only student-appropriate features and data, so that I have a focused learning experience without administrative distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Student user logs in, THE RBAC_System SHALL provide access to dashboard, timetable viewing, attendance viewing, and notifications
2. THE RBAC_System SHALL restrict Student users from accessing professor-only features like attendance marking and class cancellation
3. THE RBAC_System SHALL restrict Student users from accessing admin features like user management and system analytics
4. THE RBAC_System SHALL filter data to show only classes and information relevant to the Student user
5. THE RBAC_System SHALL hide UI elements that require higher permissions from Student users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a professor, I want to access teaching-related features and manage my classes, so that I can effectively conduct and monitor my courses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Professor user logs in, THE RBAC_System SHALL provide access to all Student features plus professor-specific capabilities
2. THE RBAC_System SHALL allow Professor users to mark attendance for their assigned classes
3. THE RBAC_System SHALL allow Professor users to cancel classes and send notifications
4. THE RBAC_System SHALL allow Professor users to view analytics for their classes
5. THE RBAC_System SHALL restrict Professor users from accessing admin-only features like user management

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin, I want full system access to manage users, monitor system performance, and configure settings, so that I can maintain the platform effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Admin user logs in, THE RBAC_System SHALL provide access to all system features and data
2. THE RBAC_System SHALL allow Admin users to create, update, and delete user accounts
3. THE RBAC_System SHALL allow Admin users to assign and modify user roles
4. THE RBAC_System SHALL allow Admin users to access comprehensive system analytics and reports
5. THE RBAC_System SHALL allow Admin users to manage system-wide notifications and settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure backend API endpoints that validate user roles, so that unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Protected_Endpoint SHALL validate JWT tokens before processing any authenticated requests
2. WHEN a request is made to a protected endpoint, THE Authentication_Middleware SHALL extract and validate the user role
3. THE Authorization_Decorator SHALL reject requests from users without sufficient role permissions
4. THE Protected_Endpoint SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes for unauthorized access attempts
5. THE RBAC_System SHALL log all authorization failures for security monitoring

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend interface to adapt based on my role, so that I only see features and options that I'm authorized to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates the application, THE Role_Context SHALL provide role information to all components
2. THE Protected_Route SHALL redirect unauthorized users to appropriate pages or show access denied messages
3. THE RBAC_System SHALL conditionally render UI elements based on user role permissions
4. THE RBAC_System SHALL adapt navigation menus to show only accessible features for each role
5. THE RBAC_System SHALL display role-appropriate content and data throughout the application

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious stakeholder, I want comprehensive audit logging of role-based access attempts, so that I can monitor system security and detect potential threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RBAC_System SHALL log all successful and failed authentication attempts with role information
2. THE RBAC_System SHALL log all authorization decisions including granted and denied access attempts
3. THE RBAC_System SHALL record role changes and administrative actions with timestamps and user details
4. THE RBAC_System SHALL provide audit trail functionality for security review and compliance
5. THE RBAC_System SHALL alert administrators of suspicious access patterns or repeated authorization failures
